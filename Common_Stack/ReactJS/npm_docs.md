## React JS

### What is React JS?
React JS is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building fast and interactive user interfaces (UI), especially for single-page applications (SPAs). It enables developers to create large web applications that update and render efficiently as data changes.

### Why Use React JS?
- **Component-based architecture** for reusable code
- **Fast rendering** using the Virtual DOM
- **Seamless data flow** with unidirectional binding
- **Industry adoption** (used by Facebook, Instagram, Netflix, etc.)
- **Easy integration** with other libraries and frameworks

### Key Features of React JS
- **JSX (JavaScript XML):** Write HTML within JavaScript
- **Components:** Independent, reusable UI pieces
- **Virtual DOM:** Efficient UI updates
- **Hooks:** Functional component features like state and side effects
- **One-way Data Binding:** Predictable data flow

## NPM (Node Package Manager)

### What is NPM?
NPM is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to install, manage, and share reusable code packages (modules). NPM is essential when working with JavaScript libraries like React.

### Why Use NPM?
- **Simplifies installation** of third-party libraries
- **Manages dependencies** and project versions
- **Centralized `node_modules` directory**
- **Automates scripts** using `npm run`

### Key Features of NPM
- **Registry of Packages:** Thousands of open-source libraries
- **Dependency Management:** Tracks and resolves version conflicts
- **Scripts:** Automate build, test, and deployment tasks
- **Global & Local Installation:** Flexible scope
- **Lockfiles:** Ensures consistent installs (`package-lock.json`)
